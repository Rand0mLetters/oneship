just so I can copy and paste to build the android app

Checklist before building app:
    config.js:
        - serverURL is NOT localhost
        - version is 0.0.1 more than previous (unless new features)
    backend/index.js:
        - /version is updated, equals app version

npx eas build -p android --profile preview
